# For users ðŸ˜€
Colors. With this tool you can generate **beautiful colors**. 
Generation of many **different gradients** is also available. 
To generate a new color or gradient, just click on the *generate button*. 
All *information* about the current color or gradient is displayed below the color card. 
If you accidentally generated a new color, but the previous color seemed to you more successful, then you can press the *back button* and thus navigate through the previously generated colors.

## How can this be useful?
This can be helpful when choosing a color for a new design.
The algorithm that controls the color generation **does not use all very saturated colors** in the generation.
This way, you only get the colors that can be used in the design.
Colors like `#00FF00` are never seen here, as they might be in other color matching tools.
